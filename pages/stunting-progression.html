		<h1>Cheer Stunting Progression</h1>
		
		<p><em>Warning: Cheerleading is dangerous and all cheerleading should be performed under the supervision of a skilled coach. This material is here for a reference. The writer of this material takes no liability for the actions performed.</em></p>
		
		<p>Material provided here is partially from the mind of zacharyc, but much of it is taken directly from videos by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thekelvinlam/">Kelvin Lam</a>. Having had the privilege of learning from him and counting him as a friend, I'm grateful to have this knowledge and be able to pass it on.</p>
		
		<p>Progressions are the way to go.</p>
		
		<h2>Flyer Position</h2>
		
		<p>Stand with feet together.</p>
